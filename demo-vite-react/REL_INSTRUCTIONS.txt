REL_EDITOR Vite React (Style only) export

Generated CSS: src/REL_overrides.css
Generated entry: src/REL_entry.jsx

To run with the REL entry without editing source files permanently:
1. Temporarily point your Vite entry import to src/REL_entry.* in your local run flow,
   or create a local script that uses REL_entry as the startup module.
2. Keep your original entry file unchanged: src/main.jsx

No package.json changes were made automatically.
