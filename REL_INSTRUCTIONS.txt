REL_EDITOR Tree Drag and Drop

1. Open the Tree tab.
2. Drag a node row with the mouse.
3. Drop behavior:
   - Top half of a row: Insert before
   - Bottom half of a row: Insert after
   - Center area of a row: Nest inside (if target can contain children)
4. During drag:
   - Blue horizontal line = before/after drop
   - Blue row highlight = nest inside drop
   - Small tooltip shows the action (Insert before / Insert after / Nest inside)
5. Hold over a collapsed row for ~750ms to auto-expand during drag.
6. Invalid drops are blocked (self/descendant/system nodes).
7. After drop, preview updates immediately and the moved node stays selected.
8. Click Save Patch to persist structural moves in rel_editor/patch.json; Export Safe applies them in REL_* outputs.
