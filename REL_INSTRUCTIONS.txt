REL_EDITOR Tree Drag and Drop

1. Open the Tree tab.
2. Drag a node row with the mouse.
3. Drop behavior:
   - Top half of a row: Insert before
   - Bottom half of a row: Insert after
   - Center area of a row: Nest inside (if target can contain children)
4. During drag:
   - Blue horizontal line = before/after drop
   - Blue row highlight = nest inside drop
   - Small tooltip shows the action (Insert before / Insert after / Nest inside)
5. Hold over a collapsed row for ~750ms to auto-expand during drag.
6. Invalid drops are blocked (self/descendant/system nodes).
7. After drop, preview updates immediately and the moved node stays selected.
8. Click Save Patch to persist structural moves in rel_editor/patch.json; Export Safe applies them in REL_* outputs.

Background Solid regression check

1. Load demo_project.
2. Select a visible section (for example .hero), switch Background Mode to Solid, pick a strong color.
3. Confirm color appears immediately in preview.
4. Select a container/div inside that section, set another solid color, confirm immediate preview update.
5. Click Save Patch and verify rel_editor/override.css has [data-rel-id="..."] rules with:
   - background-color: <color> !important;
   - background-image: none !important;
6. Switch the same element from Image/Gradient back to Solid and verify image/gradient no longer covers the solid.
